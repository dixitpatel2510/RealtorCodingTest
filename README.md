Anagram Finder Programming Task:

What is Anagram?
An anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another, such as
cinema , formed from iceman.


This project contains 2 files:
anagram-finder.py
dictionary.txt

Note : this project doesn't requires more dependency so didn't create requirements.txt file

A Program is written in Python.

How program works:

- Program convert user input string to lower case character based sorted string, for example: STOP will convert into opst.
- Convert the input dictionary file into list.
- Then compare the length of user input string and length of each elements from dictionary file list, If both are same then sort that list element and convert that into a      string.Then compared the sorted string from user input and sorted string from dictionary files.If both are same then append the unsorted list element from dictionary file into a empty list



Programming Setup:

Run python --version and ensure python3 on your system.If python3 is not installed then first install python3 to your system.

1. clone this project and go to directory where project is cloned.
2. Run following command: python anagram-finder.py dictionary.txt in terminal to run program
2. Enter a word as user input which will find anagrams related a word
3. To exit from program, enter command:exit

Note- The text file containing the words must be in the same path as that of the python code.

Note: It take me around 2 hours to finished this task.
